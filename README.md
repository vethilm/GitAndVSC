# GIT Fundamentals
## Individual Project – Spring 2024
### The Mission: Mastering Git Through Practical Application
In the ever-evolving world of web development, proficiency in version control is not just a skill—it's an essential tool of the
trade. This project will not only deepen your understanding of Git but also challenge you to document your learning journey.
You will create a micro-site, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optionally), to showcase what you've learned about Git. This site
itself will be a practical example of your skills, as you manage its development as a project on GitHub. From your initial research
to the final deployment on GitHub Pages, every aspect of this project will reflect your mastery of Git in a real-world application.
Embrace this opportunity to illustrate your journey, skills, and creativity, setting you on the path to becoming a proficient and
versatile web developer.
Please consider this as a milestone deliverable that a potential employer would highly value.

- Branching with VS Code
  -   Use VS Code to create and switch between branches.
  -   Understand the concept of branching for feature development or bug fixes.
- Working with Remote Repositories
  - Add and manage remote repositories directly from VS Code.
  - Push to and pull from these remotes using the VS Code interface.
- Pull Requests and Code Reviews within VS Code

## The Deliverable
Interpretation of the site design is up to you, however, I would recommend a landing page with compelling content / imagery
above the fold, followed by pages or sections that clearly outline the content and steps noted above. For each section, please
include a step sequence for users to follow with enough information to get them from point A to point B, etc. The site will be
hosted utilizing GITHub’s pages service. You will submit this URL via D2L.
